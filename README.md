# Azure's Cloud Platform: Building Serverless Applications

Azure provides us with the perfect toolkit of serverless components to build powerful cloud solutions. We have Azure Functions to run our custom code, Logic Apps for our workflows and easy integration, API Management for securing our data and processes, and finally Service Bus for our messaging needs. And all this truly serverless, meaning highly available, dynamic scale and allowing us to focus on logic instead of infrastructure.

In this session you will learn how to combine these services to create powerful scenarios, with minimal effort. Come and see how easy it is to get started, while still gaining a lot of possibilities.
